%Description de l'aborescences - Structure des fichiers
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
../LMOK - répertoire des scripts et fichier de configuration (sous git)
../Data - répertoire des données CCR et INSEE (uniquement en local ou sur le cloud des mines)
Pour l'étude sur le département du Rhône, on a
	data69.csv fichier initial CCR
	departement-69 répertoire contenant les informations INSEE (limites,...)

Les fichiers créés/lus par les scripts sont stockés dans le répertoire ../Data
- CCR_data_Rhone.Rdata (créé par 00_import_data.Rmd avec data69.csv et departement-69)
- CCR_Rhone.Rdata (créé par 01_EDA.Rmd avec CCR_data_Rhone.Rdata)
- CCR_Rhone_meshCoords.asccii (créé par 02_compute_meshing.Rmd)
